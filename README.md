# Blockchain Explorer

## About the application

This application is used to see information about the ndau blockchain.

## Setting environment variables:

- FRONT_END_URL: This is the URL sent in the email that brings the user to your site for verification/ reset-password. So it should be your current blockchain explorer URL
- HOST_USER: This is the email from which the user verification/ reset-password message is sent. Ideally you'd want something like info@ndau.tech
- HOST_PASS: This is a pass-phrase generated by the service, in our case 'gmail' to permit the use of the mail with the API/Package (nodemailer) we're using. The process would vary from email provider to provider
- TOKEN_KEY : This is a string used to generate the JWT for verification/ reset-password. Should just a be long random string

## Starting the app locally

Make sure you have project dependencies like node/npm, nodemon and yarn:

Node installation:
```
brew install node
```

Yarn installation (Facebook's packing tool to be used with React):
```
npm install -g yarn
```

Start by installing front and backend dependencies. While in this directory, run the following commands:

```
yarn install
```

After both installations complete, run the following command in your terminal:

```
yarn start
```

That's it, your app should be running on <http://localhost:3000>.
